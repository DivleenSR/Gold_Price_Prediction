# Gold Price Prediction 

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict future gold prices based on historical data. The workflow involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain historical gold price data from reliable sources.

2. **Data Pre-processing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, removing outliers, scaling features if needed, etc.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gain insights into the data by visualizing trends, patterns, and relationships between variables that may influence gold prices.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new relevant features from the existing data to improve the model's predictive power.

5. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or others suitable for time-series forecasting.

6. **Model Training**: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train the selected model on the training data.

7. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, or others.

8. **Model Tuning**: Optimize the model's hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or random search to enhance its accuracy.

9. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to a production environment for making real-time predictions or batch forecasting.

10. **Monitoring and Updates**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data as it becomes available to maintain its relevance and accuracy over time.
